# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a very simple rock, paper, scissors game that I created while doing The Odin Project. This game served as a basic introduction to Javascript for me.

"rockpaperscissororiginal.html" is the first version that I made, and "rockpaperscissor.html" is the updated version with a simple UI.
